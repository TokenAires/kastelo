### Removing Supports

The print will contain generated support structures from the slicer, further there are three modeled support structures that are marked green below. The trapezoid shaped one can be easily broken out. The two cylindrical shaped support structures have a slot to turn them loose. If turning is not successfull use a small players to remove the support. [ go easy ]

### Smoothing out buttons

After removing the support you should see the two buttons. They are printed within the enclosure so they will be stuck after the print. Use a small screw driver to turn them carefully for a few minutes until they become easy to press.
